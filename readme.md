## 2. Disaster Response App - Natural Language Processing with Machine Learning Pipelines  - October 2019
We analyze disaster data to build a model for an API that classifies new input data. A data set used to create a machine learning pipeline contains real messages that were sent during disaster events. The machine learning pipeline analyzes and categorizes these events, so that an emergency worker can input a new message and get classification results in several categories. The web app also displays some visualizations of the data

## 3. Building Recommendation Engine Based on Collaborative Filtering and Matrix Factorization- November 2019
The project analyses the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform, and make recommendations to them about new articles. We used rank-based recommendation method, collaborative filtering and matrix factorization algorithms. The latter works by decomposing the user-item interaction matrix into the product of two lower dimensionality rectangular matrices. This family of methods became widely known during the Netflix prize challenge due to its effectiveness as reported by Simon Funk in his 2006 blog post: https://sifter.org/~simon/journal/20061211.html

## 4. Check Your YouTube Trending Potential - Natural Language Processing App - December 2019
 YouTube maintains a list of the top trending videos on the platform. For some videos it is predictable to become trending like a new song from a popular interpreter, or a new movie trailer. For other videos, the trends can be surprising. In this project, we build an app that rates a new video title trending potential. To do this, explore trending videos in a period of six months, second we process YouTube titles with natural language algortihms and third we create a machine learning model. At the end we implement a Flask app, that rates a new video title on a trending scale.

# Finished Projects - 2018
## 5. Finding Donors - Supervised Learning Project

### About
Evaluating and optimizing several different supervised learners to determine which algorithm will provide the highest donation yield while also reducing the total number of letters being sent.

### Libraries
- Python 3 with Jupyter Notebooks
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn 
- Matplotlib

## 6. Image Classifier - Deep Learning with Neural Networks
I implemented an image classification application. This app trains a deep learning model on a data set of images, then use the trained model to classify images. The code was developed using a Jupyter notebook to make sure your training implementation works. Then, it was converted the code to a Python application that runs from the command line. 

### Libraries
- Python 3 with Jupyter Notebooks
- NumPy
- pandas
- torch
- torchvision
- collections
- PIL import Image
- matplotlib

## 7. Identify Customer Segments - Unsupervised Learning
Analyzed relationships between demographics features, organized the population into clusters, and see how prevalent customers are in each of the segments obtained.

### Libraries
- Python 3 with Jupyter Notebooks
- NumPy
- pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib (for data visualization)
- Seaborn (for data visualization)
