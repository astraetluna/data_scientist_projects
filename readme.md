## 2. Disaster Response App - Natural Language Processing with Machine Learning Pipelines  - October 2019
We analyze disaster data to build a model for an API that classifies new input data. A data set used to create a machine learning pipeline contains real messages that were sent during disaster events. The machine learning pipeline analyzes and categorizes these events, so that an emergency worker can input a new message and get classification results in several categories. The web app also displays some visualizations of the data

# Past Projects - 2018
## 3. Finding Donors - Supervised Learning Project

### About
Evaluating and optimizing several different supervised learners to determine which algorithm will provide the highest donation yield while also reducing the total number of letters being sent.

### Libraries
- Python 3 with Jupyter Notebooks
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn 
- Matplotlib

## 4. Image Classifier - Deep Learning with Neural Networks
I implemented an image classification application. This app trains a deep learning model on a data set of images, then use the trained model to classify images. The code was developed using a Jupyter notebook to make sure your training implementation works. Then, it was converted the code to a Python application that runs from the command line. 

### Libraries
- Python 3 with Jupyter Notebooks
- NumPy
- pandas
- torch
- torchvision
- collections
- PIL import Image
- matplotlib

## 5. Identify Customer Segments - Unsupervised Learning
Analyzed relationships between demographics features, organized the population into clusters, and see how prevalent customers are in each of the segments obtained.

### Libraries
- Python 3 with Jupyter Notebooks
- NumPy
- pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib (for data visualization)
- Seaborn (for data visualization)
